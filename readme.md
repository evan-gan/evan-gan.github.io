Hi there! This repo mainly just hosts a fun project I made for counterspell boston to let the attendees know how long they had left. You can try it out [here](https://evan-gan.github.io/cs/) if you want to set your own time, or [here](https://evan-gan.github.io/cs/?time=2024-11-24T11%3A03) for a pre-filled out timer.

You can find a live demo I made in the demo section of high seas
